# Learning Maven Project

Here I'll include of any quick POCs I'd like to learn/experiment.program o

## CompletableFuture
This Maven module is a sample program on CompletableFuture, sequencing series of steps in a process and using Metrics.

### Metrics
pingali.jeevan.completable_future.CompletableFutureApp
             count = 100
         mean rate = 79.14 calls/second
     1-minute rate = 0.00 calls/second
     5-minute rate = 0.00 calls/second
    15-minute rate = 0.00 calls/second
               min = 0.01 milliseconds
               max = 12.54 milliseconds
              mean = 0.20 milliseconds
            stddev = 1.26 milliseconds
            median = 0.01 milliseconds
              75% <= 0.02 milliseconds
              95% <= 0.76 milliseconds
              98% <= 1.11 milliseconds
              99% <= 1.41 milliseconds
            99.9% <= 12.54 milliseconds
